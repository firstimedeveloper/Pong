# Pong
A simple game of Pong using SFML and the Clion IDE

The game is from the tutorial, http://gamecodeschool.com/sfml/coding-a-simple-pong-game-with-sfml/,
but most of the code is altered.

This is more like a tinker project than the original Pong where I try to learn building applications using SFML.
